## Project Objectives

The client emphasised that the main goal of the website is to create a user-friendly and efficient
platform for prospective buyers and tenants to peruse property listings. The website should provide
available homes in a visually appealing manner while also giving detailed information that stimulates
user participation, such as contacting agents or scheduling viewings.

## Property Types and Listings
The client plans to predominantly display residential properties such as houses, apartments, and
townhouses. Furthermore, the website should include listings for commercial properties like office
spaces and retail stores, as well as a smaller portfolio of vacant land parcels.

## Search and Filtering Functionality
To enhance user experience, the client requires robust search and filtering options allowing users to
narrow down properties based on:
* Geographic location (city, suburb, neighborhood)
* Price range with minimum and maximum values
* Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
* Property type (house, apartment, commercial, land)
* Amenities such as swimming pools, parking availability, pet-friendliness, and garden/outdoor
spaces
The goal is to enable users to quickly and easily find listings matching their specific preferences
without wading through irrelevant results.
Property Details Page Requirements

## Each property listing page should include:
* A high-quality photo gallery highlighting the propertyâ€™s interior and exterior
* Clear display of asking or rental price
* Detailed description outlining key features and selling points
* Complete address with an embedded interactive map for easy location visualization
* Floor plans, if available
* Contact information of the responsible agent, including phone number and email
* A call-to-action or form allowing users to request additional information or schedule a viewing
appointment
The client expects these elements to provide users with sufficient information to build trust and
motivate further action.

## User Account Features
The client expressed interest in implementing user accounts to allow visitors to:
* Register and manage personal profiles
* Save favorite listings for easy access
* Set up notifications or alerts for new listings matching their criteria
* Potentially communicate with agents through an internal messaging system
However, the client acknowledges that these features may be deferred to a future phase following the
initial website launch.
