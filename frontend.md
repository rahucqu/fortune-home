# ðŸ’» Front-End Development â€“ Fortune Home

This document outlines the **Front-End development work** completed by **Harsh Adhiyol** for the [Fortune Home Project](https://github.com/rahucqu/fortune-homes).  
The frontend is built using **Inertia.js**, **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, integrated into the **Laravel 12** backend.

- **TailwindCSS** â€“ utility-first responsive styling.  
- **shadcn/ui** â€“ pre-styled UI components (buttons, forms, modals).  
- **Google Maps API** â€“ embedded maps for property listings.
